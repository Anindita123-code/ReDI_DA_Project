## Project Overview:

This project has been undertaken to assess the impact of the Global Pandemic on World Economies, The ready dataset of 2020 has been obtained from Kaggle.com, and has the following columns 

•	Country Code
•	Location
•	Date
•	Total_cases
•	Total_deaths
•	Stringency_index
•	Population
•	Gdp_per_capita
•	Human_development_index

With this information, there is a possibility of working with the following

1.	Clean up the dataset
2.	Country-wise analysis of each of the highlighted metrics from above section
3.	A comparative analysis of each of these metrices for all the different countries in the dataset
4.	A Date-wise analysis of how each country performed on each of the metrices
5.	A predictive analysis for each country on each of the parameters for example, how increase or decrease of stringency_index would impact the total_death counts of the country etc.

## Common Definitions

### Per capita gross domestic product (GDP) 
GDP Per capita is a metric that breaks down a country's economic output per person and is calculated by dividing the GDP of a country by its population.

### What does the Stringency Index tell us?
It provides a picture of the stage at which any country enforced its strongest measures.
Oxford provides an overlay of countries’ death curve and their stringency score.
Some countries saw their deaths just begin to flatten as they reached their highest stringency, such as Italy, Spain, or France.

As China pulled stronger measures, its death curve plateaued.

In countries such as the UK, the US, and India, the Oxford graphs find that the death curve has not flattened after strictest measures were enforced.

### Human Development Index

The HDI considers three indicators of human development, namely, life expectancy, education, and per capita income.
The Human Development Index (HDI) is a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable and have a decent standard of living. ... The HDI is the geometric mean of normalized indices for each of the three dimensions.
